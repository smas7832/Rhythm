# Festive Themes - Bug Fixes & Improvements

## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. **Festive Themes Not Applying**
**Problem**: Festive themes were enabled but colors weren't changing in the UI.

**Solution**:
- Added festive color blending to `RhythmTheme` in `Theme.kt`
- Created `applyFestiveColors()` function that blends festive colors with base color scheme
- Added `festiveThemeEnabled`, `festiveThemeSelected`, and `festiveThemeAutoDetect` parameters to `RhythmTheme()`
- Updated `MainActivity.kt` to pass festive theme settings to `RhythmTheme()`
- Colors now blend at 85% for primary, 75% for secondary, and 70% for tertiary
- Automatic light/dark theme adjustment for better contrast

**Result**: Festive themes now visibly change app colors when enabled! 🎨

### 2. **Tab Text Not Adjusting for 4 Tabs**
**Problem**: With 4 tabs (Overview, Colors, Fonts, Festive), text was cramped and hard to read.

**Solution**:
- Modified `TabButton` in `ThemeCustomizationBottomSheet.kt`
- **Inactive tabs now show icon only** (text hidden)
- **Active tab shows icon + text** with smooth expand/collapse animation
- Adjusted padding: selected tabs get 12dp, inactive tabs get 8dp
- Icon size increased to 20dp for better visibility when alone
- Text changed to `labelMedium` style for better fit

**Result**: Clean, spacious tabs that expand when selected! 📱

## Technical Details

### Color Blending Algorithm
```kotlin
fun applyFestiveColors(baseScheme, festiveTheme, darkTheme) {
    // Adjust colors for theme
    val adjusted = if (darkTheme) {
        lighten(festiveColor) // Better visibility in dark
    } else {
        festiveColor // Keep vibrant in light
    }
    
    // Blend with higher factors
    primary = blend(base.primary, adjusted, 0.85f)
    secondary = blend(base.secondary, adjusted, 0.75f)
    tertiary = blend(base.tertiary, adjusted, 0.70f)
    
    // Auto-adjust text colors for contrast
    onPrimary = if (luminance > 0.5) Black else White
}
```

### Tab Button Behavior
```kotlin
TabButton(selected) {
    Icon(size = 20.dp) // Larger for icon-only
    
    AnimatedVisibility(visible = selected) {
        Text(...) // Only show when selected
    }
}
```

### Active Festival Indicator
```kotlin
if (festiveEnabled && activeFestival != NONE) {
    Card {
        Emoji + Name + PulsingDot
    }
}
```
