A comprehensive festive theme system has been added to Rhythm that allows users to celebrate special occasions with themed decorations, colors, and animated particles throughout the app.

## Features Implemented

  - Each theme has unique movement patterns

- **Performance Optimized**:

### 4. **Theme Customization UI** (`ThemeCustomizationBottomSheet.kt`)
New **"Festive" tab** added with:

  - Only if `applyToSplash` is true
  - Uses selected or auto-detected theme
- Animated particles during loading
- No interference with existing splash animations

## User Experience

### First-Time Setup
1. Open **Settings > Themes > Festive tab**
2. Enable "Festive Themes"
3. Toggle "Auto-detect Festival" (recommended)
4. Adjust particle intensity if desired
5. Choose where to apply (Splash, Main UI, or both)

### Manual Selection
- Disable "Auto-detect Festival"
- Browse available festivals
- Select any festival to celebrate anytime
- Each card shows:
  - Festival name and emoji
  - Color scheme preview
  - Description

### Customization Options
- **Particle Intensity**: Control how many particles appear (less busy vs more festive)
- **Show Particles**: Turn off particles but keep festive colors
- **Selective Application**: Choose splash screen only, main UI only, or both

## Technical Details

### Date-Based Auto-Detection
- **Diwali**: Oct 20 - Nov 15
- **Christmas**: Dec 15 - Dec 31
- **New Year**: Dec 25 - Jan 7
- **Halloween**: Oct 20 - Oct 31
- **Valentine's Day**: Feb 10 - Feb 20
- **Holi**: Mar 1 - Mar 15
- **Easter**: Mar 20 - Apr 20
- **Independence Day (India)**: Aug 10 - Aug 20
- **Thanksgiving**: Nov 20 - Nov 30

*Note: Some dates are approximate as festivals vary by year*

### Performance Considerations
- Particle count scales with intensity: 10-30 particles
- 60 FPS animations using coroutines
- Canvas-based rendering for efficiency
- Particles automatically respawn when off-screen
- No impact on app performance when disabled

### Future Enhancements (Ready for)
The system is designed to support:
1. **Custom Images**: Image placeholder support is built-in
   - Replace particle types with custom festival images
   - Add background decorations (garlands, lights, etc.)
   - Festival-specific overlay images

2. **More Festivals**: Easy to add new festivals:
   ```kotlin
   LUNAR_NEW_YEAR(
       displayName = "Lunar New Year",
       description = "Chinese New Year celebration",
       emoji = "🧧",
       primaryColor = Color(0xFFD32F2F),
       secondaryColor = Color(0xFFFFD700),
       tertiaryColor = Color(0xFFFFFFFF),
       particleColors = listOf(...)
   )
   ```

3. **Sound Effects**: Can add festival-specific sounds
4. **Custom Date Ranges**: User-defined festival dates
5. **Regional Variants**: Different colors for same festival
6. **Animation Presets**: Different particle behaviors per festival

## Usage Examples

### For Users
```
1. Enable festive themes in Settings
2. Let auto-detect handle it, or choose your favorite
3. Enjoy festive decorations during celebrations!
```

### For Developers Adding Images
```kotlin
// In FestiveDecorations.kt, replace particle drawing with images:
when (particle.type) {
    ParticleType.DIYA -> {
        // Draw image instead of circles
        drawImage(
            image = diyaImage,
            topLeft = Offset(particle.x, particle.y),
            alpha = particle.alpha
        )
    }
}
```

## Design Philosophy
- **Non-intrusive**: Easy to disable, doesn't interfere with core functionality
- **Performance-first**: Efficient animations, no lag
- **Customizable**: Users control intensity and where it appears
- **Culturally Inclusive**: Celebrates festivals from around the world
- **Graceful**: Subtle and elegant, not overwhelming
- **Accessible**: Works with all themes and color schemes

## Conclusion
The festive theme system is **production-ready** and provides a delightful way for users to celebrate special occasions. It's fully integrated, performant, and designed for easy expansion with custom images and more festivals in the future.

Happy celebrating! 🎉
